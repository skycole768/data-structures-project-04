    To compile my project : javac SortDriver.java
    To run my code with an input file: java SortDriver fileName.txt
    To run my code with no input file and a a user spcecified length of data to test: java SortDriver

    Additionally, I did cite a good bit of of my code and algorithm's logic from Mr.Meena's slides as it was stated ok to do so in the project guidelines.
